                <p>Hayao Miyazaki</p>
                <p>1941 - </p>
                <p>Miyazaki is a director, writer, and producer for the Japanese animation studio named Studio Ghibli. His work has been nominated and won
                    multiple international film awards and is best known for the strong female characters and themes of environmental awareness.<p>
                <p>I grew up watching many of the films produced by the studio he co-founded, so his form of visual storytelling was a huge influence
                    in my own artistic endeavors.

                    <p>Jordan Peele</p>
                    <p>1979 - </p>
                    <p> Peele is a director, writer, and producer who started off his career most notability as a comedian and has since dwelled into the
                        genre of horror and psychological thrillers in film. He made his film directorial
                        debut in 2017 with Get Out, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I had my reservations when first watching Get Out when it was first released since I'm not a fan of horror,
                    but the attention to detail and really great writing of the film made me a fan of Peele's take on the genre.

                    <p>1935 - 2018</p>
                    <p>Takahata was also a director, writer, and producer under the Japanese animation studio Studio Ghibli. He co-founded the studio alongside 
                        Miyazaki, and was highly influencial in the creative direction and style for the studio overall. His early career
                    focused on TV shows, during which he spearheaded the 1974 animated adaptation of Heidi, Girl of the Alps.</p>
                    <p>
                    His adaptation of Heidi was something I also watched as a child and have fond memories of, but his work as a producer was defininetly
                    a highlight during his time in Studio Ghibli.
