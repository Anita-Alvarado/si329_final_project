        <div id="Brett">
            <p>Jan Brett</p>
            <p>1949 - </p>
            <p>Brett is a illustrator and writer best knwon for her children stories. Her work encompasses different cultures and topics,
                but her attention to detail and inclusion of animals are staples in her illustrations.
            </p>
            <p>
                My family immigrated to the US when I was in 2nd grade, and I remember checking out so many of Brett's books as I was still learning to
                read in English since the illutrations were so helpful and fun.

        <div id="Polacco">
            <p>Patricia Polacco</p>
            <p>1944 - </p>
            <p>Polacco is a children's book author and illustrator who grew up and currently resides in Michigan. Because of this, a lot of
                her books depict her childhood growing up in Union City, MI. Her stories focus on family and her experience and stuggles as a child with
                dyslexia.
            </p>
            <p>Since Polacco is a very well known artitst and fellow Michigander, my elemtary school had a reading unit where we covered several of
                her books. Her art style also has a very soothing aspect to it, so it made the themes of her books so much more approachable and
                memorable.
            </p>

        <div id="Van Allsburg">
            <p>Chris Van Allsburg</p>
            <p>1949 - </p>
            <p>Van Allsburg is an author and illustrator for childrens books who is also a fellow Michigander and University of Michigan Alumni.
                His book The Polar Express was famously adapted as an animated film in 2004, and other titles have been adapted as well.
                  </p>
            <p>Van Allsburg art style is very disctintive, with a bit of an air of mystery around it. It was very fun to read his books
                growing up and come up with even more stories just based on his illustrations. </p>
            <p>Featured work: "The Mysteries of Harris Burdick", 1984, Charcoal pencil</p>
