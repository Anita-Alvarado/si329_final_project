        <div id="van Gogh">
            <p>Vincent van Gogh</p>
            <p>1853 - 1890</p>
            <p>Van Gogh was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter and considered one of the most famous of the movement.
                Despite lacking recognition during his lifetime and suffering from both mental illness and financial struggles,
                his artwork is now renowed worldwide.</p>
            <p>
                I came to know of van Gogh through an art class project in 3rd grade and have since admired his use of color
                and brush stroke style.

        <div id="Mucha">
            <p>Alphonse Mucha</p>
            <p>1860 - 1939</p>
            <p>Mucha was a Czech painter and most well known figure of the Art Nouveau movement. His most famous works are his series
                of posters and prints for French theater productions of the time.
            </p>
            <p>I really became a fan of Mucha's work after a trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC, where I bought a series
                of postcards with his prints. His decorative style and use of lines and shapes still influence my creative approach.

        <div id="Monet">
            <p>Claude Monet</p>
            <p>1840 - 1926</p>
            <p>Monet was a French painter and now synonomous figure of the Impressionist art movement. His most famous series of works revolved
                around his depictions of his home gardens in Giverny, France, which are still preserved and open for visitors.
            </p>
            <p>I also came to know of Monet and his work through another school project where we recreated the water lilies series. What
                I loved most then and still do now, is the use of color and blending he utilized in his pieces, which give a very hazy and soft
                appearance.
